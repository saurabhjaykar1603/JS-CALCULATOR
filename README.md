A JavaScript calculator is a web-based application that performs mathematical operations using JavaScript programming language. It can be used for basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more complex calculations involving trigonometric, logarithmic, and other mathematical functions.

A typical JavaScript calculator will have a user interface with a display screen for inputting numbers and viewing the results of calculations. It may also have buttons or keys for entering numbers, operations, and functions. The calculator may have additional features such as memory functions, conversion between units of measurement, and the ability to save and recall previous calculations.

The calculator is programmed to take user inputs and perform the requested mathematical operations, displaying the results on the screen in real-time. The code for a JavaScript calculator can be written from scratch or built using pre-existing libraries and frameworks. It can also be designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and device types, making it accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
